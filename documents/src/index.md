# Introduction

Element Framework (EF) provides components and tooling, aligned with Refinitiv Workspace's design system, to help developers build applications faster and more efficiently.

Components are built using technology native to the browser, allowing them to be lightweight and work with any web framework.

## Design System

Built on a solid foundation, Element Framework is able to adapt to the needs of your design. Components bring in visual, functional and developmental consistency to your products and development practices.

A library of foundational components are provided to kickstart your development and get products delivered faster and more efficiently.

### Refinitiv Products

Halo is the official theme to use for building any Refinitiv products and is available in both light and dark variants.

Themes are designed to be extendable, allowing styling changes to fit branding and device specifications.
