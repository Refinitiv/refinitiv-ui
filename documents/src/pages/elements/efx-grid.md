## Usage

Import EFX Grid and its themes into your application. To follow Refinitiv design system, it is required styles of some native elements e.g. typography.

```javascript
// import element and its Halo dark theme
import '@refinitiv-ui/efx-grid';
import '@refinitiv-ui/efx-grid/themes/halo/dark';

// import native styles for typography, css variables, etc.
import '@refinitiv-ui/halo-theme/dark/imports/native-elements';
```

Now the EFX Grid can be easily created by just writing the tag and setting the configuration as shown below:

```html
<body>
    <efx-grid></efx-grid>

    <script>
        var grid = document.getElementsByTagName("efx-grid")[0];
        grid.config = {
            /* See the document for all available options */
        };
    </script>
</body>
```
