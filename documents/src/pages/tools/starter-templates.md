# Starter Templates

## Getting Started

::todo::

Use the following command to create a new element template to work with. If you're new to creating elements, it's best to start with the [tutorial](./tutorials/element).

```bash
npx @refinitiv-ui/create-element my-element
cd my-element
npm start
```

*> Authors should be very careful when choosing the name of their element if they want to publish it later in a public package registry such as npm.
*>
*> Avoid using a name that is prefixed with `ef-`, such as `ef-element`. The `ef-` prefix is a reserved keyword used for [foundational elements](./elements/foundational). The `efx-` prefix is preferred when creating a community element.
