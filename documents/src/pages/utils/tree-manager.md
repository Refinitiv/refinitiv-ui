# Tree Manager

Tree Manager is a simplified version of Collection Composer providing an ability to manage nested items in [Tree](/elements/tree)/[Tree Select](/elements/tree-select) component with APIs for reading and updating item properties. It works in conjunction with [Tree Node](/custom-components/utils/tree-node). Most of the time, getTreeNodes(), getTreeNode() and TreeNode are all you need.

@> Tree Manager supports type generic defining the type of its items. In this document, this generic type is noted as `T`.
