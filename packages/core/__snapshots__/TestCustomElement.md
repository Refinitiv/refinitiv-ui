# `TestCustomElement`

#### `Test create and exec decorator with no theme twice`

```html
Only one version of a Custom Element can be registered in the browser

[test-custom-element-2-tag] has already been defined.

Potential causes:
1. No deduplication task has been performed
2. The same element definition has been loaded in multiple bundles
3. A single package has been upgraded, without upgrading other EF dependencies

Recommended fix:
1. Run 'npm dedupe' in you project folder
2. Rebuild your project
